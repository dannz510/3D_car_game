## About

"3D_car_game" is a public repository created by dannz510. It represents an early exploration into creating three-dimensional interactive experiences on the web. While primarily using HTML, it lays the groundwork for a browser-based 3D car racing game, highlighting how structural markup can be the basis for more complex visual and interactive elements.

## Features

* **3D Car Game Concept:** Presents a basic 3D car racing environment.
* **Web-Based:** Runs directly in your browser.
* **HTML-Centric:** Built with a primary focus on HTML structure.

---

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** The core and currently 100% of the listed code, providing the structure for the game. For a 3D game, this HTML file likely embeds or links to external libraries (e.g., Three.js, Babylon.js) or relies on advanced CSS/JavaScript techniques that might not be reflected in the language analysis but are essential for the "3D" and "game" aspects. Further development would typically involve significant JavaScript for game logic and CSS for styling.
